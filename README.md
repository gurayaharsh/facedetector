## About 

facedetector is a web application which allows registered users to log in and submit image links for facial detection and recognition. It makes calls to Clarafia's celebrity recognition API. It returns the image with a border drawn on the face, the identified celebrity name and tallys the number of entries submitted by the user.
This repository contains the front-end of the application.
